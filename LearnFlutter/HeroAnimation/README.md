# Flutter Hero Animation

You’ve probably seen hero animations many times. For example, a screen displays a list of thumbnails representing items for sale. Selecting an item flies it to a new screen, containing more details and a “Buy” button. Flying an image from one screen to another is called a hero animation in Flutter, though the same motion is sometimes referred to as a shared element transition.

This guide demonstrates how to build standard hero animations, and hero animations that transform the image from a circular shape to a square shape during flight.
